<p>Welcome to the little rats developments and updates page!
    <br>Here I will share with you all the ideas I have to improve lil'rats</p>
<ul>
    <li>Accounts system and dress-up game</li>
    <li>minigames
        <ol>
        <li> desert runner </li>
            <li> puzzle game</li>
        </ol>
    <li>rat stats and XP system</li>
    <li> rp chatroom / chatbox</li>
    <li>Player trophy room and tack room where you can organise all your rosettes and trophies, and place your rats on this backdrop</li>
    <li>assign rosettes/prizes/items to individual rats. Special items locked to rats that go with them on sale. (like selling a horse with its tack)</li>
    <li>rat registry/archive page on the website where you can search the archive and view family trees</li>
</ul>
<p>lilrat auto database system + somehow integration with toyhouse to manage sales and trades with less admin and less risk
    <br>❥better website with better hosting so I can implement some cool javascript games (tumblr wont let u post javascript :(( and i cant afford other hosting rn )
    <br>❥👏dress👏up👏game👏
    <br>❥iron out whatever rarity system we might use (idk i need help on this lol) (im completely averse to putting in rarity but ik it's sometimes fun to have)
    <br>❥Lilrat chatroom (log into the room, choose different backdrops, select your rat avatar and walk about the screen with arrow keys, +chat function. +dressup accessories function. great for RP and just chilling out)
    <br>❥👏rat👏stats and levelling-- not via ARPG! Via minigames contests & quests!
    <br>❥Rat battles? 🤔 a game!! something to DO with your rats
    <br>❥ rat accessories and items
    <br>❥ rat tokens & breeding tickets (eventually)</p>
